# Release notes

## 0.2.0 — unreleased candidate

- Fullscreen terminal UI with themes, framed results, exact approval controls and quieter motion.
- Interactive persona editing, persisted runtime learning and feedback/revision restoration.
- Agent selection before delegation and checked, confirmed session deletion.
- 42 curated offline ECC skills and 71 default ECC subagent roles, with upstream licenses and hash manifests.
- Shell sequencing through the shared permission parser and model-capacity-based context handling.
- Default MCP SDK, saved installation-local server configuration, interactive connection management and lazy broker-bound native calls. OAuth browser authorization (Authorization Code + S256 PKCE) is supported for HTTP servers; HTTP credential profiles remain deferred.
- Consolidated CI, source/wheel resource checks, vendored-data lint exclusions and removal of tracked environment backup artifacts.
- Opt-in, independently gated semantic response caching for auxiliary/read-only calls, prompt-cache modes with an enforced minimum prefix, protected learned-compression spans on both complete and streaming calls, shadow telemetry, local startup warmers, and read-only `machina optimization` status/economics commands. All response-path modes default off; model selection and authority are unchanged.
- Resumed sessions now continue with native user/assistant history after a sawtooth compaction boundary; stable turns stay append-only for provider prefix caches, evicted turns fold into a durable summary, and the dynamic tail prunes cold tool output to single-line tombstones.
- Hot-path sweep: linear tool-call pair detection, a bounded cache for skill token normalization, event-loop-safe terminal cancellation joins, and corrected request-projection default documentation.

This candidate has not been published or deployed. See [release readiness](docs/verification/RELEASE_READINESS.md) for evidence and open deployment gates. Runtime adaptation does not train neural weights or authorize self-editing.
